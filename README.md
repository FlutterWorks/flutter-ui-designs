## Requirements to run locally

> Just in case if you ran into errors make sure you're using correct flutter & dart version. In order to support desktop build master branch is a requirement & Master branch is not stable so breaking changes happen very often.

> A formal warning. In order to compile app properly on your machine you'll need to switch master channel with exact revision. By doing so the process will delete any previous stable/beta flutter/dart sdk. Thank you <a href="https://github.com/3mrdev" target="_3mrdev">@3mrdev</a> for letting me know of this issue. I'll look into the fvm or any other version manger when I get more free time to spend on it.

> I did spent some time to integrate <a href="https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm">FVM</a> in `Windows` but I ran into some sorts of errors. After spending some hours to solve the issue & not getting any success I parked the idea on side as currently using master branch directly is much easier & stable solution.

- Flutter master channel & Framework â€¢ revision `72aa23eb93`
  - Run `flutter --version` to check it
- Dart VM version: 2.7.1
  - Run `dart --version` to check it
- Follow these step to use correct revision version
  - Run `cd \$FLUTTER_HOME` (or the path where your flutter is installed)
  - Run `git checkout master`
  - Run `git checkout 72aa23eb93`
- To enable desktop & web builds run the relevant command
  - Run `flutter --enable-web`
  - Run `flutter --enable-macos-desktop`
  - Run `flutter --enable-linux-desktop`
  - Run `flutter --enable-windows-desktop`
- Run `flutter doctor` this command will show you what dependencies you need to install.

## Getting started with code

> Please note that this project's code is not meant for beginners! If you're just getting started with flutter I recommend you to explore some ToDo and basic setState apps and get yourself familiar with flutter and dart eco-system because in this project intermediate and advance implementations are use which will confuse you and won't help much in terms of learning.

- There are 2 entry files for this project `main.dart` & `main.mobile.dart`. It was necessary because I'm using Firebase analytics and crashlytics and there isn't desktop support for Firebase yet.
- `Navigator.dart` is responsible for managing routes, handles custom transition, pass parameter in screens and control navigation with keyboard shortcuts.
- `UI.dart` provides constant for building responsive UI.
- `configs/AppDimensions.dart` this is the magical file. It provides the app with:
  - My custom size unit based on device's width, height & pixel density.
  - Responsive containers.
  - Padding multiplier unit (I learned it with experience instead of using 1,2,3px should use multiplier. it helps maintain constancy around the app).
- `Widgets/Screen.dart` This widget is necessary when building a new screen.
  - configure theme & font style.
  - It also receive a `belowBuilders` parameter which builds custom background (This enables us to build Parallax, Animated background & Any thing you could imagine in background). you can find an example in `Screens/Download/Download.dart`
- Code structure is pretty much simple.
  - Don't import anything form ScreenA in ScreenB.
  - Don't import anything from Screen/Widget in universal files.
  - Don't import anything from ScreenA specific Widget in universal files.
  - Each Screen will have `Dimensions.dart` where you can write Screen's responsive logic.
  - I didn't use snake_case in naming convention just because I don't prefer it.
  - I use `this` for class's properties & methods I helps keep track of variables & functions.

## Scripts

- `vslaunch.dart`
  - `dart sciprts/vslaunch.dart`
  - This script will make vscode configuration file with all of your connected devices.
  - You can live debug app on multiple devices at once from vs code.
  - Each device's debug logs on separate **DEBUG CONSOLE**.
  - Very useful for testing UI for multiple devices simultaneously.
